# SDG-Index-in-different-nations
Investigating the relationship between the Sustainable Development Goals and the SDG Index in developed, developing and least developed nations.

The research problem seeks to establish a quantitative relationship between the Sustainable Development Goals index of different countries around the world and the individual SDG scores of goals 1 through 17.
The network of interconnectedness between the goals and the SDG index is explored to find out the contributions of each goal. This helps in policymaking and the allocation of resources towards the goals accordingly. This research not only enhances the effectiveness and precision of global efforts toward sustainable development but also identifies areas where countries can prioritize investments and support to boost their overall progress in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

According to (Cernev & Fenner, 2020), the vast interdependencies among the 169 targets that make up the 17 Sustainable Development Goals have not gotten a lot of coverage up until recently. Moreover, the consequences of failing to meet the Sustainable Development Goals could expose mankind to existential and global catastrophic risks. In order to identify and prioritize the essential SDGs that, when accomplished, will have the intended feedback effect on other objectives, the article looks at systems techniques. Additionally, leverage points that could lessen the likelihood of existential and global catastrophic risks in the event that the SDGs are not met or if dominant feedback loops persist are identified. For the purpose of creating successful policy interventions, it is critical to recognize these loops and comprehend the characteristics of the system architecture they represent.

The following fundamental SDGs are determined by carefully examining a causal loop diagram that conceptually connects all of the objectives based on a study of current literature: 
Goals 1 and 2 (No Poverty), 3 (Good Health and Well-Being), 14 (Life Below Water), and 15 (Life on Land). These serve as essential byproducts of accomplishing other objectives and are also necessary in preserving a sound basis of environmental and human resources, which serves as the foundation for advancing other objectives. A third set of objectives that can serve as significant leverage points is discovered by looking at a variety of possible global threats based on an assessment of existential and global catastrophic risk. SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 14 are the most crucial of these. SDG 2: Zero Hunger; SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth; SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production; and SDG 16: Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions all have significant responsibilities to play in relation to SDG 4: Quality Education. All of the SDGs must work in concert with one another to achieve their goals in order to shift the world system toward more desired outcomes and lower the risk that is now rising.

An article (Xiao et al., 2024) explores the global transboundary synergies and trade-offs among Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) from an integrated sustainability perspective. It quantifies the transboundary interactions between 768 pairs of SDG indicators, considering various transmission channels such as trade, river flow, ocean currents, and air flow. The study demonstrates that high-income countries, despite comprising only 14.18% of the global population, significantly contribute to total SDG interactions worldwide (60.60%). It also reveals that transboundary synergistic effects via international trade are more pronounced with trade partners outside the immediate geographic vicinity, while nature-caused flows result in stronger transboundary synergistic effects among neighboring countries. The findings emphasize the importance of enhancing collaboration among countries to leverage transboundary synergies for achieving the SDGs globally.
The study introduces the concept of integrated sustainability, which extends beyond traditional weak and strong sustainability perspectives by incorporating spillover effects generated by transboundary interactions across regions. It identifies four pillars of sustainability: economy, society, environment, and spillover effects. The research classifies transboundary interactions into human-caused flows (e.g., international trade) and nature-caused flows (e.g., river flow, ocean currents, and air flow). By quantifying the magnitude and direction of these interactions, the study provides insights into the complex interconnected relationships between countries in their progress towards achieving the SDGs.
